# Customer-Segmentation-Using-Cluster-Analysis
The project on customer segmentation using cluster analysis aims to segment customers 
based on their similarities in terms of demographic, geographic, and behavioral attributes. 
The study involves the use of various clustering techniques, including k-means clustering, 
K-Mode clustering, Gaussian Mixture model clustering, Agglomerative clustering, and 
K-prototype clustering to identify distinct customer segments. This project analyzes a 
large Amazon sales dataset of customer transaction and demographic data, which is 
preprocessed and transformed to extract relevant features. It's outcomes include 
the identification of customer segments and their characteristics, such as age, income, 
location, buying behavior, and preferences. Results provide valuable insights 
to marketing teams in developing targeted marketing campaigns, improving customer 
experience, and increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty. This project's methodology 
and findings demonstrate the effectiveness of cluster analysis as a powerful tool for 
customer segmentation and marketing strategy development.
